Licensed under SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1
```

### Family Styles
```
5x3 0–300

Comes as a variable font with a size axis to modify dot size from 0—300, 
as well as 15 separate instances (each increasing the dot size by 20 units).

* Future releases will include more widths and more variable axes. *
```

### Character Set
```
1300+ glyphs

Only Latin-based languages for now but a lot of ’em
Various styles (see section below)
Extensive punctuation including case-sensitive forms
superscript numbers, (unicase) letters, and some punctuation
Small caps (unicase)
Math characters including fractions
Proportional, oldstyle, and tabular figures
Roman numerals
Arrows for days
Miscellaneous symbols
```

### Stylistic Sets
```
Stylistic Set 01: (Mono/duo)spaced forms (kerning must also be disabled)
Stylistic Set 02: (A/de)scenders
Stylistic Set 03: Wider capitals
Stylistic Set 04: Boxy forms
Stylistic Set 05: Open counters
Stylistic Set 06: Shorter diacritic characters (experimental!)

The stylistic sets can be chained together so, for example, a wider, 
boxy C with open counters is available.
```

### Drawing Quality
```
As good as it's gonna get. Every glyph ultimately inherits from a single component.
```

### Tracking & Kerning
```
Very good.

Users can aslo easily apply additional kerning in increments of +−100 to 
achieve grid-perfect layouts.
```

### Grid-Perfect Leading
```
Divide Adobe's auto leading in half for one dot size between lines or refer 
to the leading formula and table below for more specific adjustment.

Leading Formula:
x = font size
y = desired number of dot spaces between lines
leading = x ÷ 10 × (y + 5)
```
| Font Size | Leading (0 dots) | Leading (1 dot) | Leading (2 dots) | Leading (3 dots) | Leading (4 dots) |
