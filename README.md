### Stylistic Sets
```
Stylistic Set 01: Monospaced forms (kerning must also be disabled)
Stylistic Set 02: (A/de)scenders
Stylistic Set 03: Wider capitals
Stylistic Set 04: Boxy forms
Stylistic Set 05: Open counters
Stylistic Set 06: Shorter diacritic characters (experimental!)

The stylistic sets can be chained together so, for example, a wider, 
boxy C with open counters is available.
```

### Drawing Quality
```
As good as it's gonna get. Every glyph ultimately inherits from a single component.
```

### Tracking & Kerning
```
Very good.

Users can aslo easily apply additional kerning in increments of +−100 to 
achieve grid-perfect layouts.
```

### Leading
```
For grid-perfect leading (exactly one dot size between lines), divide Adobe's 
auto leading in half or refer to the table below for common conversions.
```
| Font Size  | Leading |
| ---------- | ------- |
| 12pt       | 7.2pt   |
| 14pt       | 8.4pt   |
| 18pt       | 10.8pt  |
| 21pt       | 12.6pt  |
| 24pt       | 14.4pt  |
| 36pt       | 21.6pt  |
| 48pt       | 28.8pt  |
